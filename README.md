### 4. Data Source
This project uses [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) as the data provider. The API delivers detailed weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, UV index, precipitation, air quality values (PM10, SO2, CO, O3, NO2), sunrise and sunset times, and several-day forecasts, all in JSON format suitable for Power BI integration.

### 5. Features / Highlights

**Business Problem**  
Weather-dependent operations and planning require up-to-date, accurate, and location-specific weather intelligence, not always easily accessible in a consolidated visual form.

**Goal of the Dashboard**  
To provide a one-stop interactive dashboard that dynamically displays live weather data and forecasts for user-selected cities, supporting informed decisions and weather trend analysis.

**Walkthrough of Key Visuals**  
- **City Selector:** Switch dynamically among multiple cities (e.g., Hyderabad, Chennai, Manali).  
- **Current Conditions Card:** Displays temperature, weather type (e.g., mist), humidity, wind speed, pressure, UV index, precipitation, and visibility.  
- **7-Day Forecast:** Line chart showing temperature trends and daily weather summaries.  
- **Air Quality Index:** Circular gauge plus values for PM10, SO2, CO, O3, NO2 with qualitative status (e.g., "Good").  
- **Sunrise and Sunset:** Time display for sunrise and sunset for selected city.  
- **Chance of Rain:** Bar chart visualizing rain probabilities across a week.  

**Business Impact & Insights**  
- Enables businesses in logistics, travel, and event planning to monitor weather changes live.  
- Supports environmental monitoring through air quality insights.  
- Facilitates personal and professional weather awareness and risk mitigation.
